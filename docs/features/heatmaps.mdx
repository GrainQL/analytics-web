## What Are Heatmaps?

Heatmaps show you where users click and how far they scroll — as a visual overlay on your actual pages. Instead of reading spreadsheets, you see behavior directly on your site.

Grain captures click positions and scroll depth automatically through the Grain Tag. No extra code needed.

**Real-world example**: An e-commerce team noticed their "Add to Cart" button had a 2% click rate on mobile. The heatmap showed users were tapping a product image they expected to be clickable — but it wasn't. Making the image tappable increased add-to-cart by 34%.

## Click Heatmaps

Click heatmaps record every click position on the page and render them as a heat gradient — hot spots show where users click most.

What you can learn:
- **Which CTAs get attention** and which get ignored
- **Dead clicks** on elements users expect to be interactive
- **Content engagement** — are users reading or skipping sections?
- **Navigation patterns** — which menu items get the most clicks?

The Grain Tag records click coordinates automatically on every page where it's installed.

## Scroll Tracking

Scroll tracking measures how far down the page users scroll, shown as a gradient from top (100% of users see this) to bottom (fewer users reach here).

What you can learn:
- **Content fold line** — where most users stop scrolling
- **Engagement depth** — do users read your full page or bail early?
- **Optimal placement** — put your most important content where users actually see it

## Viewing Heatmaps in Studio

Heatmaps are visualized through Studio, Grain's browser extension:

1. Install Studio from your dashboard
2. Navigate to any page on your site
3. Open Studio and select the **Heatmap** view
4. Toggle between **Click** and **Scroll** views
5. Filter by date range or device type

<Note>
  **Paid plans only**: Heatmap visualization in Studio requires a paid Grain plan. Click and scroll data is still collected on all plans — you just need a paid plan to view the visual overlays.
</Note>

## DOM Snapshots

Grain periodically captures DOM snapshots of your pages. These snapshots are used to render accurate heatmap overlays, even if your page layout changes over time.

### How Snapshots Work

- Grain Tag automatically captures a snapshot of the page DOM
- Snapshots include the page structure, styles, and layout
- They're used as the canvas for rendering heatmap overlays in Studio
- Multiple snapshots are stored over time, so you can view heatmaps for past layouts

### PII Masking

Snapshots automatically mask personally identifiable information:

- Form input values are replaced with placeholder text
- Email addresses and phone numbers are redacted
- Custom masking rules can be configured in your dashboard

### Excluding Elements from Snapshots

If you have sensitive content that shouldn't appear in snapshots, add the `grain-no-snapshot` class:

```html
<!-- This element won't appear in DOM snapshots -->
<div class="grain-no-snapshot">
  <p>Sensitive content here</p>
</div>
```

Any element with `grain-no-snapshot` (and its children) will be excluded from snapshot captures.

## Device-Specific Tracking

Click and scroll patterns differ significantly between mobile and desktop. Grain tracks each device separately:

- **Desktop**: Mouse clicks, scroll wheel, trackpad gestures
- **Mobile**: Tap positions, touch scrolling
- **Tablet**: Treated as mobile by default

Filter heatmaps by device in Studio to see how behavior differs across screen sizes.
