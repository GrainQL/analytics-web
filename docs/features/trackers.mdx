## What Are Trackers?

Trackers let you monitor clicks and interactions on specific HTML elements using CSS selectors. Point at a button, link, or form — Grain counts every interaction automatically.

No code changes required. Set up a tracker in the dashboard or use Studio's visual picker, and you're live in seconds.

**Real-world example**: A SaaS company discovered 60% of trial users abandoned at the pricing page. One tracker on the mobile CTA revealed it was below the fold — moving it up increased trial-to-paid conversions by 23%.

## Tracker Types

### Conversion Trackers

Count how many unique visitors interact with a specific element. Use these for measuring goals: signups, purchases, downloads.

- Tracks unique conversions per visitor
- Shows conversion rate as a percentage of total visitors
- Ideal for CTAs, checkout buttons, and form submissions

### Metric Trackers

Count total interactions, including repeat clicks from the same visitor. Use these for engagement metrics.

- Tracks every interaction (not deduplicated)
- Shows raw interaction counts over time
- Ideal for navigation patterns, content engagement, and feature usage

## Creating Trackers

### In the Dashboard

1. Go to **Conversions** in your dashboard sidebar
2. Click **Create Tracker**
3. Enter a CSS selector (e.g., `#signup-btn`, `.cta-button`, `[data-action="purchase"]`)
4. Name the tracker (e.g., "Signup Button Clicks")
5. Choose the type: **Conversion** or **Metric**
6. Set URL scope (optional — see below)
7. Save

### In Studio (Visual Picker)

Studio lets you create trackers visually without writing CSS selectors:

1. Open Studio on any page of your site
2. Click the **Tracker** tool in the toolbar
3. Click on the element you want to track
4. Studio generates the CSS selector automatically
5. Name the tracker and choose its type
6. Save — it's immediately active

Studio is the fastest way to set up trackers, especially for non-technical team members.

## URL Scope Filtering

By default, trackers fire on every page where the element exists. Use URL scope to limit where a tracker is active:

| Scope | Behavior | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **All pages** | Fires everywhere the element appears | Track a global nav link |
| **URL contains** | Fires on pages whose URL contains a string | `/pricing` matches `/pricing`, `/pricing/enterprise` |
| **URL equals** | Fires only on an exact URL match | `/checkout` matches only `/checkout` |

URL scoping prevents false positives. If you have the same `.cta-button` class on multiple pages but only care about the homepage CTA, set the scope to URL equals `/`.

## Tracker Properties

Each tracker stores:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Human-readable label (e.g., "Hero CTA") |
| **Selector** | CSS selector targeting the element |
| **Type** | `conversion` or `metric` |
| **URL pattern** | Scope filter (all, contains, equals) |
| **URL value** | The URL string for contains/equals matching |

## Viewing Conversion Data

Once trackers are active, view results in the **Conversions** dashboard:

- **Conversion rate**: Percentage of visitors who interacted with the tracked element
- **Total conversions**: Absolute count of unique conversions
- **Trend graph**: Conversions over time (daily/weekly/monthly)
- **Page breakdown**: Which pages drive the most conversions (for multi-page trackers)

Filter by date range, device type, or traffic source to segment your data.

## Tips for Effective Trackers

- **Use specific selectors**: `#checkout-btn` is better than `.btn` — avoid matching unintended elements
- **Name descriptively**: "Hero CTA — Homepage" tells you more than "Button 1"
- **Start with conversions**: Track your most important goals first, then layer in metric trackers for engagement
- **Combine with Tracks**: Set up a [Track](/features/tracks) to see the full user journey leading to a conversion
