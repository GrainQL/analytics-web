## What Is Mission Control?

Mission Control is your command center for tracking business goals. Define what success looks like — signups, purchases, engagement targets — and Mission Control shows you how you're tracking against those goals in real time.

Instead of digging through event data to answer "are we on track?", Mission Control gives you the answer at a glance.

**Real-world example**: A B2B startup set a goal of 500 demo requests per month. Mission Control showed they were at 62% by mid-month, but the attribution breakdown revealed that blog content drove 4x more demos than paid ads — so they shifted budget to content, hitting 120% of goal by month end.

## Setting Up Goals

1. Navigate to **Mission Control** in your dashboard sidebar
2. Click **Create Goal**
3. Define the goal:
   - **Name**: A clear label (e.g., "Monthly Signups")
   - **Target event**: The event that counts as a goal completion (e.g., `signup_completed`)
   - **Target value**: The number you're aiming for (e.g., 500)
   - **Time period**: Daily, weekly, or monthly
4. Save — Mission Control starts tracking immediately

Goals pull from your existing event data, so historical progress is available right away if you've been tracking the target event.

## Viewing Goal Performance

Each goal shows:

- **Progress bar**: How close you are to hitting the target
- **Current count vs. target**: Raw numbers at a glance
- **Trend line**: Performance over time with historical comparison
- **Pace indicator**: Whether you're ahead or behind schedule based on the time elapsed in the current period
- **Attribution breakdown**: Which traffic sources, pages, or campaigns drive the most goal completions

## Attribution

Mission Control connects goal completions back to their sources:

- **Traffic source**: Organic search, paid ads, social media, direct, referral
- **Landing page**: Which pages users first visited before converting
- **Campaign**: UTM-tagged campaign attribution
- **Device**: Desktop vs. mobile conversion rates

This helps you understand not just *how many* goals you hit, but *why* — so you can double down on what works.

## Studio Intelligence Pane

When using Studio on your site, the intelligence pane surfaces Mission Control data in context:

- See goal progress for the current page
- View which trackers and events on this page contribute to your goals
- Get suggestions for optimization based on current performance

This brings Mission Control insights directly into your workflow while browsing your site.
