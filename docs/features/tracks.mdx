## What Are Tracks?

**Tracks** help you answer the most important question in product analytics: *"How do users get from point A to point B?"*

Instead of looking at isolated events, Tracks reveals the **complete journey** users take through your product—from where they start to where they succeed (or drop off).

Think of it like GPS for your product: you set a starting point and destination, and Tracks shows you all the routes people take, which paths work best, and where people get lost.

## Why Use Tracks?

**Traditional analytics tell you *what* happened. Tracks show you *how* it happened.**

Use Tracks to:

- **Understand conversion funnels**: See exactly where users drop off
- **Discover optimal paths**: What do successful users do differently?
- **Identify friction points**: Which steps cause the most abandonment?
- **Validate hypotheses**: Does that new feature help or hurt conversions?
- **Segment behaviors**: How do different user groups navigate differently?

**Real example**: You notice signup conversions are down. With Tracks, you discover that 60% of users abandon after viewing the pricing page—time to reconsider your pricing strategy!

## How Tracks Work

### Define Your Journey

Every Track has three components:

1. **Start Event**: Where the journey begins (e.g., "page_viewed: /signup")
2. **Goal Event**: The desired outcome (e.g., "account_created")
3. **Filters** (optional): Segment by user properties, date ranges, or event attributes

### Grain Analyzes the Paths

Once you define a Track, Grain automatically:

- Reconstructs user sessions using a 30-minute inactivity window
- Extracts all event sequences between your start and goal
- Identifies conversion paths (successful) and deadend paths (abandoned)
- Calculates key metrics like conversion rate and time to goal

### Visualize the Results

You get an **interactive graph** showing:

- **Nodes**: Events in the journey
- **Edges**: Transitions between events (thickness = number of users)
- **Hub nodes**: Critical convergence points where many paths intersect
- **Color coding**: Green paths reached the goal, red paths abandoned

## Key Concepts

### Conversion Paths vs. Deadend Paths

- **Conversion paths**: User journeys that successfully reached the goal event
- **Deadend paths**: Journeys that stopped before reaching the goal

Grain shows both types so you can see what works and what doesn't.

### Hub Nodes (Convergence Points)

Not all events are equally important. Grain uses graph theory to identify **hub nodes**—critical events where many user journeys converge.

Hub nodes are scored using:
- **Flow**: How many users pass through this event
- **Degree**: How connected it is (in-degree + out-degree)
- **Betweenness**: How often this event lies on paths from start to goal
- **Stability**: How consistent the outgoing traffic is
- **Goal proximity**: Likelihood of reaching the goal from here

**Why it matters**: Hub nodes are leverage points. Optimizing these events has the biggest impact on conversions.

### Time to Goal

Grain calculates how long users take to complete journeys:

- **Median time**: The middle value (50th percentile)
- **P25**: 25% of users convert faster than this
- **P75**: 75% of users convert faster than this
- **P95**: 95% of users convert faster than this

**Use this to**: Set timeout windows, identify slow steps, or measure the impact of optimizations.

## Page and Section Events in Tracks

Grain automatically normalizes page views and section views to create **distinct nodes for each page and section**, helping you understand exactly which pages and content sections drive conversions.

### Normalized Event Patterns

When you track events, Grain transforms them into more meaningful representations:

- **Page Views**: Each unique page becomes a separate event
  - Example: `page_view:/home`, `page_view:/pricing`, `page_view:/checkout`
  - Shows specific page transitions in your funnel
  
- **Section Views**: Tracked sections appear as distinct events  
  - Example: `section_view:hero`, `section_view:cta`, `section_view:testimonials`
  - Reveals which content sections engage users before conversion

- **Regular Events**: All other events appear unchanged
  - Example: `button_clicked`, `purchase_completed`, `video_watched`

This transformation happens automatically in the Tracks analysis—no code changes needed!

### Why This Matters

Instead of seeing generic "page_view" nodes that obscure your funnel, you get granular visibility:

**Before normalization:**
```
page_view → button_clicked → page_view → purchase_completed
```

**After normalization:**
```
page_view:/home → button_clicked → page_view:/pricing → purchase_completed
```

Now you can see that users typically view your homepage before pricing, helping you optimize each step.

### Logarithmic Normalization

To prevent power users from skewing results, Grain applies **logarithmic normalization** to path counts:

| User Activity | Raw Count | Normalized Contribution |
|--------------|-----------|------------------------|
| 1 page visit | 1 | log(2) = 0.69 |
| 10 page visits | 10 | log(11) = 2.40 |
| 100 page visits | 100 | log(101) = 4.62 |
| 1000 page visits | 1000 | log(1001) = 6.91 |

**Result**: A single power user with 1000 page views won't drown out 50 regular users with 10 views each.

This ensures your Tracks analysis reflects genuine user patterns, not just the behavior of a few extreme outliers.

### Creating Tracks with Normalized Events

When creating a Track, you can now target specific pages and sections:

**Example: Homepage to Purchase Flow**
- **Start event**: `page_view:/home` (users landing on homepage)
- **Goal event**: `purchase_completed` (successful conversion)
- **Result**: See exactly which paths from homepage lead to purchases

**Example: Section Engagement Analysis**
- **Start event**: `section_view:pricing_table` (viewing pricing)
- **Goal event**: `checkout_initiated` (starting checkout)
- **Result**: Measure how pricing page engagement impacts conversions

<Tip>
  **Scroll events excluded**: To keep your graph clean, `scroll:section_*` events are automatically filtered from Tracks. Use the Heatmaps feature to analyze scroll behavior.
</Tip>

## Creating Your First Track

### Step 1: Navigate to Tracks

From your [Grain dashboard](https://grainql.com/dashboard), click **Tracks** in the sidebar.

### Step 2: Define Start and Goal

1. Click **Create Track** or press `Cmd/Ctrl + N`
2. **Select start event**: Choose where the journey begins (e.g., "page_viewed")
3. **Optional filters**: Add event property filters (e.g., page = "/signup")
4. **Select goal event**: Choose the desired outcome (e.g., "account_created")

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Start with broad events first (like "page_viewed" → "purchase_completed"), then add filters to segment specific flows.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Set Time Window

Choose how far back to analyze:
- Last 7 days (default)
- Last 30 days
- Custom date range (max 90 days)

<Note>
  **Why limit to 90 days?** Analyzing long time periods requires significant compute. For historical analysis beyond 90 days, contact support for custom queries.
</Note>

### Step 4: Analyze Results

Once created, you'll see:

- **Conversion metrics**: Starters, converters, conversion rate
- **Interactive graph**: Visual representation of user flows
- **Top paths**: Most common routes users take
- **Abandonment points**: Where users drop off most frequently
- **Time analysis**: How long journeys take

## Understanding the Graph

### Node Types

- **Start node** (green circle): Your starting event
- **Goal node** (blue target): Your desired outcome
- **Hub nodes** (highlighted): Critical convergence points
- **Regular nodes** (gray circles): Intermediate events

### Edge Thickness

Thicker edges = more users took this path. Hover over edges to see exact counts.

### Colors and Indicators

- **Green edges**: Lead to goal completion
- **Red edges**: Lead to abandonment
- **✓ Completed**: Transition from a successful path
- **⏳ In progress**: Transition from an ongoing journey

## Advanced Features

### Segmentation

Want to see how different user groups behave? Add segment breakdowns:

- **By country**: Do US users convert differently than EU users?
- **By device**: Mobile vs. desktop journey differences
- **By referrer**: Organic vs. paid traffic behavior
- **By custom properties**: Any property you track (plan tier, user role, etc.)

### Path Filtering

Narrow down the visualization:

- **Show only conversion paths**: Hide deadends to focus on success
- **Show only deadend paths**: Focus on where people abandon
- **Minimum user threshold**: Hide low-volume paths for clarity

### Comparing Tracks

Create multiple Tracks with different filters to compare:

- **Before/after**: Did your change improve conversions?
- **A/B tests**: Which variant performs better?
- **Cohorts**: How do different user segments compare?

## Common Use Cases

## Interpreting Results

### High Conversion Rate (>50%)

**What it means**: Your journey is well-optimized!

**Next steps**: 
- Look for patterns in successful paths
- Can you shorten the journey further?
- Scale what's working

### Medium Conversion Rate (20-50%)

**What it means**: There's room for improvement.

**Next steps**:
- Identify the biggest drop-off points
- A/B test changes to those steps
- Simplify or remove unnecessary steps

### Low Conversion Rate (<20%)

**What it means**: Significant friction exists.

**Next steps**:
- Review deadend paths—where do most people abandon?
- Talk to users—why did they stop?
- Consider a redesign of the journey

### Unexpected Paths

See users taking routes you didn't expect?

**What it means**: Your mental model doesn't match reality!

**Next steps**:
- Understand why users take these paths
- Make the unexpected path easier (if it works)
- Guide users to better paths (if it doesn't)

</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Don't**: Ignore deadend paths—they're where the learning happens!
</Warning>

## Technical Details

### Session Definition

Grain defines sessions using a **30-minute inactivity window**. If a user is inactive for more than 30 minutes, the next event starts a new session.

### Sampling for Large Datasets

For Tracks with millions of events, Grain uses **balanced sampling**:

- Ensures both conversion and deadend paths are represented
- Guarantees start and goal event visibility
- Maintains statistical significance

**Result**: Fast analysis even with huge datasets, without losing insights.

### Path Extraction Algorithm

Grain uses a graph-based algorithm:

1. **Build user event sequences** from ClickHouse
2. **Segment journeys** when users trigger the start event multiple times
3. **Extract transitions** between events with user counts
4. **Calculate hub metrics** using composite scoring
5. **Render graph** with topological ordering and force-directed layout

## Limitations & Considerations

### Time Window

Tracks analyze up to 90 days by default. For longer analysis, contact support.

### Event Volume

Very high-traffic sites (millions of events/day) may see sampled results. Core metrics remain accurate.

### Real-Time Updates

Track analysis runs on-demand, not real-time. Expect 1-2 minute compute time for complex Tracks.

### Cross-Device Journeys

If users aren't identified (via `setUserId()`), cross-device journeys won't be connected. Use user identification for best results.
