## Welcome to Grain Analytics

Grain Analytics is a modern analytics platform that helps you understand user behavior and dynamically control your application through remote configurations. Our SDK is designed to be simple, powerful, and easy to integrate.

## Why Grain Analytics?

Grain Analytics provides two powerful features that work seamlessly together:

### Analytics Tracking

Track user behavior to understand how people use your application. Grain's analytics engine helps you:

- **Understand user journeys** - See how users navigate through your app
- **Measure engagement** - Track feature usage and user interactions
- **Make data-driven decisions** - Use real data to improve your product

The SDK handles the complex parts like batching, retries, and reliable delivery, so you can focus on deciding what to track.

### Remote Configuration

Control your application's behavior without deploying code. Remote configurations let you:

- **A/B test new features** - Show different experiences to different users
- **Enable feature flags** - Turn features on/off without code changes
- **Personalize content** - Display user-specific content based on properties

Remote config uses a cache-first strategy, meaning your app loads instantly with cached values while fresh data loads in the background.
