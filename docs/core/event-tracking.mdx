## What Are Events?

Events represent actions that happen in your application. Every time a user clicks a button, views a page, or completes a purchase, you can track it as an event.

Think of events as a timeline of what users do in your app. By tracking these actions, you can:
- Understand which features users engage with most
- Identify where users drop off in your funnel
- Measure the impact of changes to your product

## Basic Event Tracking

The simplest way to track an event is with a name and properties:

```typescript
grain.track('button_clicked', {
  button_name: 'signup',
  page: '/home'
});
```

**Anatomy of an event**:
- **Event name** (`button_clicked`): What happened
- **Properties** (`button_name`, `page`): Context about the event

Event names should be clear and descriptive. Use past tense to indicate an action that already happened.

## Event Properties

Properties add context to events. They answer questions like "which button?" or "how much?":

```typescript
// Good: Rich context
grain.track('product_viewed', {
  product_id: 'abc123',
  product_name: 'Blue Sneakers',
  category: 'footwear',
  price: 89.99
});

// Bad: Too vague
grain.track('view');
```

**Best practices**:
- Include relevant context (IDs, names, amounts)
- Use consistent naming (snake_case or camelCase)
- Avoid sensitive data (passwords, credit cards)
- Keep property names simple and clear

## Automatic Batching

Here's where Grain saves you effort: events are automatically batched for efficiency.

**What is batching?** Instead of sending each event immediately (slow and expensive), Grain collects events and sends them in groups.

```typescript
// These three events...
grain.track('page_viewed', { page: '/products' });
grain.track('button_clicked', { button: 'filter' });
grain.track('search_performed', { query: 'shoes' });

// ...are batched and sent together
// after 5 seconds or when 50 events accumulate
```

**Default behavior**:
- Events batch every **5 seconds**
- Or when **50 events** accumulate
- Whichever comes first

You can customize this:

```typescript
const grain = createGrainAnalytics({
  tenantId: 'your-tenant-id',
  batchSize: 100,        // Send after 100 events
  flushInterval: 10000   // Or every 10 seconds
});
```

## Manual Flushing

Sometimes you need to send events immediately:

```typescript
// Track a critical event
grain.track('purchase_completed', {
  order_id: '12345',
  total: 99.99
});

// Force send immediately
await grain.flush();
```

**When to flush manually**:
- Before page navigation
- Critical events (purchases, signups)
- Before app closes or logs out
- In serverless functions

**One-time flush**: Pass `flush: true` to track():

```typescript
// This event sends immediately
await grain.track('checkout_started', {
  cart_total: 149.99
}, { flush: true });
```

## User Association

Events are more valuable when you know *who* performed them. Set a user ID to associate events with a specific user:

```typescript
// When user logs in
grain.setUserId('user_123');

// All subsequent events include this user ID
grain.track('feature_used', { feature: 'export' });
grain.track('settings_changed', { setting: 'theme' });
```

Without a user ID, events are anonymous. This is fine for public websites, but for authenticated apps, always set the user ID.

## Event Lifecycle

Understanding what happens to events helps you track effectively:

1. **Track**: You call `grain.track()`
2. **Queue**: Event added to internal queue
3. **Batch**: Queue accumulates until batch size or interval
4. **Send**: Batch sent to Grain API
5. **Retry**: If failed, retry with exponential backoff
6. **Success**: Event stored in Grain analytics

```typescript
// Configure retry behavior
const grain = createGrainAnalytics({
  tenantId: 'your-tenant-id',
  retryAttempts: 3,  // Try 3 times if failed
  retryDelay: 1000   // Wait 1s, then 2s, then 4s (exponential)
});
```

## Reliable Delivery

Grain ensures events aren't lost, even when:
- Network is slow or fails temporarily
- User closes the browser
- App crashes

**Page exit events**: Use the Beacon API for reliable delivery when users leave:

```typescript
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => {
  grain.track('page_exited', { page: window.location.pathname });
  // Beacon API used automatically - event sends even if page closes
});
```

The SDK automatically uses the Beacon API when the browser is closing, ensuring events aren't lost.

## Common Patterns

### Page View Tracking

```typescript
// Track every page view
grain.track('page_viewed', {
  page: window.location.pathname,
  title: document.title,
  referrer: document.referrer
});
```

### Button Click Tracking

```typescript
// Add to button handlers
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  grain.track('button_clicked', {
    button_name: button.id,
    button_text: button.textContent,
    page: window.location.pathname
  });
});
```

### Form Submission

```typescript
form.addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
  // Track before submission
  await grain.track('form_submitted', {
    form_name: form.id,
    num_fields: form.elements.length
  }, { flush: true });
  
  // Continue with form submission
});
```

## Debug Mode

Not sure if events are sending? Enable debug mode:

```typescript
const grain = createGrainAnalytics({
  tenantId: 'your-tenant-id',
  debug: true
});

// Now see detailed logs in console
grain.track('test_event', { test: true });
```

You'll see logs for queueing, batching, sending, and responses.
